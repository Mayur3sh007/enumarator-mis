TECH STACK
----------
- Next.js 13 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- React Context for state management

ROUTES
------
/enumerator/login            - Login page for enumerators
/enumerator/dashboard        - Main worklist (household list with filters)
/enumerator/households/new   - 4-step form for manual household entry

KEY FEATURES
------------
1. Three Data Entry Paths:
   - AI Draft verification (simulated with dummy data)
   - Manual new household entry (house-to-house survey)
   - Paper-to-digital entry (office data entry from paper forms)

2. Mobile-First Design:
   - Responsive layout that works on small phones
   - Bottom navigation bar on mobile
   - Touch-friendly tap targets
   - Scales nicely on desktop with centered content

3. State Management:
   - EnumeratorContext provides global state
   - In-memory storage (resets on page refresh)
   - Dummy data provided in lib/dummy-data.ts
   - No backend or API calls

4. Layout Components:
   - TopBar: App name, online/offline indicator, enumerator name
   - BottomNav: 5-icon navigation (Dashboard, New, Facilities, Follow-ups, Settings)
   - EnumeratorLayout: Wraps all authenticated pages

5. Reusable Components:
   - StatusBadge: Draft, Verified, Pending Docs, Not Eligible
   - SourceBadge: AI Draft, Manual, Paper
   - RiskBadge: Green, Yellow, Red indicators
   - HouseholdCard: Displays household summary in lists
   - FacilityCard: Displays facility summary in lists

DATA TYPES
----------
- Enumerator: User info (id, name, block, district)
- Household: Full beneficiary/household data with verification
- Facility: Infrastructure data (schools, PHCs, roads)
- FollowUp: Pending action items

WORKFLOW
--------
1. Enumerator logs in with ID and name
2. Views worklist of households on dashboard
3. Can filter by status (Draft/Verified/Pending Docs) and source (AI/Manual/Paper)
4. Three ways to add/verify households:
   a. Click existing household to verify AI draft
   b. Click "New Household" for manual entry
   c. Use "Paper Upload" to enter data from paper forms
5. Can view and update facility information
6. Can manage follow-up cases
7. Can view profile and log out

NO BACKEND
----------
- All data is stored in React state (EnumeratorContext)
- Dummy data is pre-loaded from lib/dummy-data.ts
- Changes persist only during the session
- No authentication, database, or API calls
- File uploads are simulated (no actual upload logic)

This is a complete, working UI prototype ready to be plugged into a larger system.
